Spiro-js
========

This is a simple spirograph drawer I made because I saw a thread about them on
reddit and wanted to play with one but I didn't actually own one.

It doesn't do much error checking yet so it might explode on wrong input. If you
find a bug, just open a issue and I'll look into it :)
